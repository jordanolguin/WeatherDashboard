# WeatherDashboard

Here is a weather dashboard for searching for the current weather and five-day forecast of any selected city using the OpenWeather API.

## Installation

N/A

Please refer to the url "https://jordanolguin.github.io/WeatherDashboard/" to go to deployed site.

## Usage

Upon page-load, the user can enter the name of any city they would like to view the current weather and five-day forecast of in the search bar. The searches are saved in local storage and appended to the DOM for the user to click on to bring up that city's current and future weather, wind speed, and humidity. An icon of the current weather is displayed as well as the current date and subsequent next five days.
